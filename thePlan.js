/*The Plan

need to watch video for explanation of the project

I think that I have basic layout done.
I think that I will need to do layout with flex.

I think that I will need to process data into 3 different arrays.

use each array to fill each of the the 'holder' div's divs
figure out how names move according to slot position using const slots

going to need eventlisteners for < < > >

going to need event listeners for divs that hold names

priority is business logic
--------------------------------------------------
name your repo acme-first-second-third
create an index.html
you can eventually move your javascript and css to separate files
focus on seeing results with every code change
start by displaying the data
then you can toggle a user being selected when being clicked on
then you can focus on moving users between lists
