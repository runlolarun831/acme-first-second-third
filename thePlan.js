/*The Plan

need to watch video for explanation of the project

I think that I have basic layout done.

I think that I will need to process data into 3 different arrays.

use each array to fill each of the the 'holder' div's divs
figure out how names move according to slot position using const slots

going to need eventlisteners for < < > >

going to need event listeners for divs that hold names

priority is business logic
