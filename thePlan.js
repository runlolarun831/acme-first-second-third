/*The Plan

*need to watch video for explanation of the project

I think that I have basic layout done.
I think that I will need to do layout with flex.

figure out how names move according to slot position using const slots
don't change actual data structure just modify what's in it
focus on divs

going to need eventlisteners for < < > > //made those buttons or dead divs

going to need event listeners for divs that hold names

priority is business logic
--------------------------------------------------
name your repo acme-first-second-third
create an index.html
you can eventually move your javascript and css to separate files
focus on seeing results with every code change
start by displaying the data
then you can toggle a user being selected when being clicked on
then you can focus on moving users between lists
